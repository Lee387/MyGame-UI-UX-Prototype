# MyGame-System-Analysis-Design

## About
Analyzed and designed MyGame, a mobile application that enables users in Jabodetabek to rent and purchase console games. The project focused on building a comprehensive system to support both customer and admin needs.

## Goal
To create a well-structured application design that supports end-to-end business processes such as game purchasing, rentals, payments, order tracking, forum interaction, and administrative management.

## Process
Developed detailed system models and deliverables, including activity diagrams, use case diagrams and descriptions, system sequence diagrams, CRUD matrices, domain model class diagrams, and state machine diagrams. These artifacts provided a clear blueprint for both functionality and process flow within the application.
